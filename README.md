# Artificial-Neural-Network-First-Project
This is my first ANN project that I've made.

Artificial Neural Network(ANN) which trains using a csv file which contains 3 columns: Color(Culoare), Length(Lungime), Width(Latime). Using these columns, the rows represent flowers that have the respective properties. The A.I. will predict if the flower is red or blue.
